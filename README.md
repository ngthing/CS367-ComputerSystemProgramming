# CS367-ComputerSystemProgramming

Introduces computer systems from a programmer’s perspective. 
Topics include data representation, assembly and machine-level representation of high-level language programs, 
the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptions, interrupts, processes and signals, virtual memory, and system-level I/O. 
Foundation for courses on compilers; networks; operating systems; and computer architecture, 
where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required.
